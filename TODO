Release 0.1: must have
======================

1) fix the DockGroup tab rendering bug

2) investigate gtk theme to render tabs, make the eclipse based
   rendering optional

3) and while doing 1 & 2, do_size_request/do_size_allocate/do_expose_event
   methods for DockGroup are not that efficient, but better than before...


Release X: the "when we have time" features
=========================================

- the gdk_draw_* functions have been deprecated for GTK+3, so use cairo
   instead

- fix DnD on win32 for gtk+ > 2.16.6: depends on gdk-win32 csw/grabs work :(

- keyboard navigation

- translations

- handle RTL

- accessibility
